Stock Price Prediction Classification using Neural Networks with an Accuracy of 77.0%.

NEURAL NETWORKS

	A Neural Network contains layers of perceptrons which are connected within layers. These layers are classified into 3 namely:
  
	a. Input Layer which takes input
  
	b. Hidden Layer which modifies connection weights
  
	c. Output Layer which gives output as desired
  
Variables:

	xij -  input from unit i into unit j
  
	wij - weight from unit i to unit j
  
	∆wji – change in weight

Algorithm:

	Step1: Initialize the network weights (value in range (0, 1))
  
	Step2: Calculate the output 
  
	Step3: Modify the weights and repeat the Step2 until the error is minimised
  
  Error is calculated using the Least Mean Square Method.
  
Modifying Weights:

	wji    wji + ∆wji
  
	∆wji = ƞ ẟj xji
